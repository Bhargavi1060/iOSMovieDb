Movie DB IOS Mobile apps

Project Tilte: Movie BD iOS Mobile Application

Description: The purpose of the project is to create an IOS app where the User can view the most popular movie list and also to provide some 
             details like thumbnail,Release year and rating.

Architecture: I have Used MVVM Architecture to create this application. It has seperate code layers like model, View, and ViewModel. 
              This architecure enhances the reusability of code. This architecture is highly testable, loosely coupled and also provides seperation of                   logic. 
              
Third party Libraries: I have used Almofire and Almofire image. AlmofireImage is an image component library for Almofire. I have used this library to load 
              the image on ViewController and I have used Almofire to make service calls.
